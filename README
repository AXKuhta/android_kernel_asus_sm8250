ASUS ZenFone 7 Linux Kernel
===========================

Use `build_kernel.sh` to build.

But first you'll need to download an appropriate toolchain and edit the paths in the following files:
- build_kernel.sh
- scripts/Makefile.lib at line 320

The script will produce files at ./out/arch/arm64/boot/

Rename `dtb.img` into just `dtb` and place it along with the `Image` into an AnyKernel3 .zip
